# carcassonne
A library for the backend of the boardgame Carcassonne

# Build
Run `npm run build` or `tsc` in current directory and javascript will be output to a `dist/` directory.

# Using Library
In addition to having inline documentation I've thrown together a simple demo program which shows how one might use it. The program does not run and is not tested
