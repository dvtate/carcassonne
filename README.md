# carcassonne
A library for the backend of the boardgame Carcassonne

# Build
Run `npm run build` or `tsc` in current directory

# Using Library
In addition to having inline documentation I've thrown together a simple demo program which shows how one might use it. The program does not run and is not tested

## TODO
#### Scoring
This is likely as simple as running through each of the followers controlled areas and discovering domain in similar way to how

#### Verify algorithms
Probably via demo or unit-tests

#### Frontend
Could do text-based or gui with grid system and images

#### Code Style
- Plenty of public members that could be made private
- If code style is super important I'd recommend using a linter
- The code for the game and game actions could likely be improved
